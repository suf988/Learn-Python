Once upon a time, a donkey lived in a small village. The donkey was known for being the most hardworking donkey anyone had ever seen. Every morning, the donkey carried heavy loads across the fields. Despite its efforts, the donkey was often teased by the children who called it a lazy donkey, but the donkey never gave up.
