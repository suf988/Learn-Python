# Q4: Use comparison operator to find out whether â€˜aâ€™ given variable a is greater than â€˜bâ€™ or not. Take a = 34 and b = 80

a = 34
b = 80

print(f"Is 34 greater than 80? {a>b}")


# trying by taking user input
inp1 = int(input("Enter first number: "))
inp2 = int(input("Enter second number: "))
print(f"Is {inp1} greater than {inp2}? {inp1>inp2}")
